# Tuning Trainer

Web app for ear training; plays pitches to test a player's ability to hear whether
a pitch is sharp, flat, in tune, etc., and by how much.

Eventually, this will feature a quiz-style format using several levels of
difficulty. Unisons, octaves, intervals; harmonic and melodic (and in between).
(More detail at a later time.)

### 23 March 2017 - Updates and Bugs

Updates to the flat/sharp quiz [here](https://travisbartholome.github.io/tuning-trainer/quiz.html)!

You can now define how accurate you want the incorrect pitch to be.
Options range from as much as 30 cents out of tune to as little as 5 cents.

We've also worked out some usability bugs.

First quiz is up! [Try it out here](https://travisbartholome.github.io/tuning-trainer/quiz.html).

This is a flat/sharp test at 30 cents out (yikes).
We'll play a base pitch, then play a unison out of tune in either direction.
Give an answer as to how the second note is out of tune (is it flat or sharp?).

It works with a mouse or with keyboard only and allows replays.
Soon, it'll keep track of your running score during a session,
and we'll work out the glaring bugs!

Idea based on my struggles with hearing intonation.
