# Tuning Trainer

## Go to the newest live version [here](https://tuning-trainer.herokuapp.com/)!

Web app for ear training; plays pitches to test a player's ability to hear whether
a pitch is sharp, flat, in tune, etc., and by how much.

Eventually, this will feature a quiz-style format using several levels of
difficulty. Unisons, octaves, intervals; harmonic and melodic (and in between).
(More detail at a later time.)

### 22 May 2017 - Intervals, Moving to Heroku

Intervals quiz has been added [here](https://tuning-trainer.herokuapp.com/intervals)!

This new version allows you to choose intervals to test, not
just unisons.

We've also moved the app to Heroku for live deployment.
This should be more flexible and easy to work with in the long run.
Links have been updated to reflect the change.

### 23 March 2017 - Updates and Bugs

Updates to the flat/sharp quiz [here](https://tuning-trainer.herokuapp.com/quiz)!

You can now define how accurate you want the incorrect pitch to be.
Options range from as much as 30 cents out of tune to as little as 5 cents.

We've also worked out some usability bugs.

### 15 March 2017

First quiz is up! [Try it out here](https://tuning-trainer.herokuapp.com/quiz).

This is a flat/sharp test at 30 cents out (yikes).
We'll play a base pitch, then play a unison out of tune in either direction.
Give an answer as to how the second note is out of tune (is it flat or sharp?).

It works with a mouse or with keyboard only and allows replays.
Soon, it'll keep track of your running score during a session,
and we'll work out the glaring bugs!
