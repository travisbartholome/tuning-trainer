# Tuning Trainer

Web app for ear training; plays pitches to test a player's ability to hear whether
a pitch is sharp, flat, in tune, etc., and by how much.

Eventually, this will feature a quiz-style format using several levels of
difficulty. Unisons, octaves, intervals; harmonic and melodic (and in between).
(More detail at a later time.)

Idea based on my struggles with hearing intonation.
